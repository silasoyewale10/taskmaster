## TITLE: ANDROID APPLICATION
### DESCRIPTION AND SUMMARY:
The main page should be built out to match the wireframe. In particular, 
it should have a heading at the top of the page, an image to mock the 
“my tasks” view, and buttons at the bottom of the page to allow going 
to the “add tasks” and “all tasks” page.

# Home Page
Contains settings, three hardcoded tasks, add task and details. 

## Add a Task
On the “Add a Task” page, allow users to type in details about a new task,
specifically a title and a body. When users click the “submit” button, 
show a “submitted!” label on the page.

All Tasks
The all tasks page should just be an image with a back button; it needs no functionality.

### DAILY CHANGE LOG:

Today, I added the homepage, the add task page and the all task page. The homepage has the
buttons to go to both the add task page and the all task page. The all task page is empty for now. 
Day 2: I added the settings page to change the username displayed on the homepage. I also added three tasks to be picked from. Each task leads you to a task page that shows the title of the chosen task.
